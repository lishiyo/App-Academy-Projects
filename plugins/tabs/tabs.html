        Bred to be a sled dog, the Siberian Husky makes a great all-around dog. They are agreeable, alert, and outgoing. They have amazing endurance, and are always willing to work and want something to do, so they need at least an hour of exercise per day. They also need to be around people or other dogs at all times.

        The Australian Shepherd, lovingly called an "Aussie," is a highly intelligent, incredibly energetic, people-loving dog who needs to have a job to do. They need lots and lots of exercise and will fit in well with an active person or family.
