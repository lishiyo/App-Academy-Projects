## Hangman

To play, just run the script:

	`ruby game.rb`

* **Phase I: You vs Computer**

* **Phase II: Computer Pwns You**

	Just tell the computer how long your word is. The computer has ~40k words in its dictionary - as long as your word is actually in there, it's surprisingly tough to beat...
